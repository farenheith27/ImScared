# Module 1 — Math Basics for Computer Science
## Objectives
_Provide the minimal but solid mathematical foundations needed to understand:_
- Algorithms
- Logic
- Data structures
- Programming
- Cryptography

# Contents
1. Essential Arithmetic
    - Basic operations with integers
    - Powers
    - Orders of magnitude
    - Fractions and percentages useful in programming
2. Light Algebra
Variables and symbols
    - Simple equations
	- Expressions with parentheses
	- Basic manipulations (moving terms, isolating x)
	- Logarithms (only what you need for complexity and cryptography)
3. Mathematical and Boolean Logic
_The most important part of the module_
	- Propositions
	- AND / OR / NOT
	- Truth tables
	- Implications
	- Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
	- How these translate into code (language-agnostic)
4. Sets, Functions, and Relations
_Essential for understanding data structures and algorithms_
	- Sets, finite and infinite sets
	- Intersection, union, difference
	- Functions and mappings
	- Domain and codomain
	- Cardinality
5. Useful Graphs and Functions in Computer Science
	- Linear
	- Quadratic
	- Exponential
	- Logarithmic
6. Computational Complexity (Super Accessible Version)
	- Intuition behind O(n), O(log n), O(n²)
	- Why log₂ appears everywhere
	- How to evaluate the “speed” of an algorithm intuitively
7. Math Applied to Cryptography
_Only the concepts needed to understand Bitcoin, hashing, keys, etc_
	- Modular arithmetic (mod)
	- Very large numbers
	- Non-invertible operations
	- Entropy and random strings
	- Why 12 vs 24-word seed phrases differ mathematically

# Exercises
- Solve 10 small algebraic expressions
- Create 5 truth tables from scratch
- Interpret 3 graphs (linear, exponential, logarithmic)
- Calculate simple logarithms “by intuition”
- Perform modulo operations (e.g., 17 mod 5)
