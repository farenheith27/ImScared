# ImScared
Just a self-made course about cryptography. I’m trying to convince myself I can understand the basics in a very short time. Sort of a challenge, a masochistic one.

First of all, I'm not an English native speaker but I'm gonna try go full English because the whole idea itself isn't bad enough for my mental health.

This repo is gonna change frequently with updates of my journey, what I understood and what I didn't.

The entire course is structured by AI, while the repository files are all self-made.

# Objectives (at 24th November - Day 1)
1. Learning something
2. Getting down again in advanced math arguments I forgot
3. Understanding code, automation, algorithmics
4. Understanding cryptography and blockchain development

5. FINAL PROJECT: Building a brand new blockchain, native token, smart contract

# Hardware
### Starting setup
_what makes the challenge challenging_
1. iMac 21" late 2013 - macOS Catalina (not upgradeable)
2. iPad Pro 2023 - iPadOS 26.1
3. Asus notebook 2014 - Win7

# Weekly routine
### Monday - Planning day
- Open Notion Dashboard
- Choose a couple of realistic _(eheh)_ objectives for the week
- Define choosen arguments time and point them into calendar
- Create a branch on the repository about the week

### Thursday to Saturday - Output
- Open dedicated branch
- Study some of the arguments
- Get done a micro-output of any kind about what you learned
- Commit -> Push

### Sunday - ~Roll down and cry~ Review
- Merge the weekly branch into main
- Write down a recap ~in Notion~ into a dedicated "journey.md" repository file with:
  - What you learned
  - What you did
  - What is not clear
- Think about next weekly branch title
