# ImScared
That's a self-made course about cryptography. I’m trying to convince myself I can understand the basics in a very short time. Sort of a challenge, a masochistic one.

First of all, I'm not an English native speaker but I'm gonna try go full English because the whole idea itself isn't bad enough for my mental health.

This repo is gonna change frequently with updates of my journey, what I understood and what I didn't.

The entire course is structured by AI, while the repository files are all self-made.

# Objectives (at 24th November - Day 1)
1. Learning something
2. Getting down again in advanced math arguments I forgot
3. Understanding code, automation, algorithmics
4. Understanding cryptography and blockchain development

5. FINAL PROJECT: Building a brand new blockchain, native token, smart contract

# Hardware
### Starting setup
_what makes the challenge challenging_
1. iMac 21" late 2013 - macOS Catalina (not upgradeable)
2. iPad Pro 2023 - iPadOS 26.1
3. Asus notebook 2014 - Win7

# Weekly routine
### Monday - Planning day
- Open Notion Dashboard
- Choose a couple of realistic _(eheh)_ objectives for the week
- Define choosen arguments time and point them into calendar
- Create a branch on the repository about the week

### Thursday to Saturday - Output
- Open dedicated branch
- Study some of the arguments
- Get done a micro-output of any kind about what you learned
- Commit -> Push

### Sunday - ~Roll down and cry~ Review
- Merge the weekly branch into main
- Write down a recap ~in Notion~ into a dedicated "journey.md" repository file with:
  - What you learned
  - What you did
  - What is not clear
- Think about next weekly branch title

# AI Used
### ChatGPT
> _from the beginning_
- Course structure
- Study materials (half of them, I found by myself the others)
- Main assistant for the process

### Google Gemini
> _since 3.12.2025_
- Explanation of topics

## Module 1 - Math "basics" (edit: added a lil sarcasm)
I started with a clear idea in mind. I don't know if one month is enought (don't think so) but let's see where we get.

ChatGPT has a big limitation of chats and file upload that slows down my momentum, I started using Google Gemini to better understand topics I read.

My idea is to keep my notes written down as much as possible inside the dedicated folder on the "module-1" branch, then give order and better look to what I learn before putting it into the Wiki. I hope to do a nice job with Mermaid that's something completely new for me and it's not part of my study.

### First week
This week is about getting over math again. I'll start with stes, logic, algebra, and some probability (if I have time).

Goal is to feel confident again with math and learn what's missing.

#### Books started
L. Battaia - _"Matematica di base"_
