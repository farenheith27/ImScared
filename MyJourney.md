# Ouverture
I like to begin every project with a chapter called like that. It makes me think about art, music, something abstract and dreamy.
As the work I'm putting my effort in is more like an opera, than a work itself.

This journey starts with **FOMO**. 
And that could be all folks but hold my beer and lemme speak because I've not embarassed myself enough yet.

I studied math, computer science, physics and programming in high school, forgetting pretty everything during last 10 years.
In last few month I got so bored I started thinking again about our world and I get to a personal conclusion:

**Cryptography, Cryptos, Computational Power, Energy, AI... theese are the future.** 

At least I think so.

Is easy to believe that "having the best hardware means owning everything".
Quantum computation is going to wreck the world as we know it, especially because the 1% will control the 99% of the new technology.
Everything in our times works by hardware and software and that's why quantum is going to be the key to everything.

I love ruin plans, going against "destiny" and write my own future.

In my head there must be a way to beat the computers. Humans **have to be better**.
I believe that any form of intelligence can generate other forms of intelligence that can be anything but superior to their Creator.

**There won't be a single computational machine that's going to overtake humanity.**
_... but there may be a small slice of humanity that will use machines to overtake the bigger slice_ and that's not an event my brain would accept as it is without doing nothing.

So here's my FOMO.

I've lost about 10 years working, making bad decisions, doing _la bella vita_, partying, playing music, knowing people, learning myself.
Don't get me wrong those years were **fucking rocking** but now I need to recover and shrink:
- 10 years of **AMO** _(Actual Missing Out)_
- Into 1 year of **ETFOMOSBA** _(Escaping the Fear Of Missing Out Something Big Again)_

That's the starting point.
I hope to made some of you laugh.
I hope to made some of you hope.
That's my journey.
That could be _our_ journey.

# Day ZERO
It's important to know that _everthing_ about the course is made with AI, by now with just ChatGPT. I'm going to use other AI in future while updating this repository.
Also, I'm going through this experience while working a full-time job on shifts. Yeah. You read right. I hate myself in some ways.
Today I started doing basic things. Maybe a list should be optimal to get them down:
- [x] Set up my Notion Dashboard
  - [x] Databases
    - [x] Calendar
    - [x] Study sources
    - [x] List of exercises
  - [x] Wrote down the course program
- [x] Got GitHub ready
  - Note on this: I still need to learn how this works properly, I think it just requires time so I'm gonna go straight forward anyway
  - [x] Created the repository _(it needs a rename even if I like the actual "ImScared")_
  - [x] Created README.md file
  - [x] Set up a LICENSE
  - [x] Set up .gitignore
  - [x] Updated bio
  - [x] Wrote down this Journal first-step

The next step for this evening is to find the source of every book/paper/video/... into the "Study Sources" database, then go to sleep.
I'm excited as a kid with a new toy, if I know myself good enough I'm gonna get frustrated in very little time _and that's gonna be the hard challenge_.

I'm not gonna say I'll update this Journal everyday, especially because I don't know how much time I really have and also some days I'll just read a ton.
This Journal is gonna be half-recap and half-diary. I like that.
Cya.

# Day 4 - 28th November
After 3 days of vaction I got back to work. I've just finished my bibliography and every _(free)_ study material now is saved as PDF on iBooks, as Favourite on GitHub or has a link in the Notion database. I did not realize how hard was going to be finding every source, as you can read between the lines this work didn't finished four days ago during a cozy evening in the hotel where I slept for work. 

The hardest ones to find were the non-english source, I needed to switch and search the english version for most of them. I could have predicted that. Tomorrow I'm gonna update the Wiki of this repository with a dedicated page for my sources, they're all completely free and I think it's gonna be nice to gather all of them into one page.

Getting out of the train and taking my walk home.
Project is growing. Slowly but consistently.

# Day 5 - 29th November - 23.40
Today I focused on writing down the Resource page of the wiki. My idea is to keep it updated when needed with new papers/books/videos I find useful for my learning. The list is full of elements, lots of them will not be used/useful but I preferred to start with more than one resource for some arguments, so I'll be sure to have at least one valid to use.

I got done the setup of my iPad also, as you can see not everything was installed because I'd like to master one working tool at a time so I made choices about them (the opposite of what I did with my resources). It will be nice to add links for every voice of the list but I'll keep this for when I'm bored but still want to be productive.

I'm seeing a lot of things to read and learn and I'm starting to get scared for real. Writing is keeping me easy as it always did in my life. I hope tomorrow to be able to setup my iMac also and finish my Week 0. I'm so excited to begin with Math. That will not be a problem anyway because the first things I need are just my textbooks and my exercise book, but I know myself good enough to understand that procrastinating is one of the worst enemies for my learning. 

I've just decided to add the hours I write those diary pages. Because why not?
_...aaaaaand I fixed some minor syntax on the README.md file._

I hate the moments while I'm doing nothing, I don't care if its because I won't or because I can't (today I was away working my job and my iMac was at home), they're just inevitable and I don't like them. My head is gonna have some bad times during this journey, I just want to go harder when I'm doing good and relax on the PlayStation when I'm doing worse. I can't decide how to feel anyway.

This morning I made pancakes for my fiancee. Next morning will be dedicated to physical exercise, piano learning and iMac setupping. Keeping on everything is hard but hell yeah I fucking love going to bed literally smashed from fatigue. 

It makes me feel alive.

Keep it on pals, see you soon.
