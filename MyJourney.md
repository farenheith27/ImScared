# Ouverture
I like to begin every project with a chapter called like that. It makes me think about art, music, something abstract and dreamy.
As the work I'm putting my effort in is more like an opera, than a work itself.

This journey starts with **FOMO**. 
And that could be all folks but hold my beer and lemme speak because I've not embarassed myself enough yet.

I studied math, computer science, physics and programming in high school, forgetting pretty everything during last 10 years.
In last few month I got so bored I started thinking again about our world and I get to a personal conclusion:

**Cryptography, Cryptos, Computational Power, Energy, AI... theese are the future.** 

At least I think so.

Is easy to believe that "having the best hardware means owning everything".
Quantum computation is going to wreck the world as we know it, especially because the 1% will control the 99% of the new technology.
Everything in our times works by hardware and software and that's why quantum is going to be the key to everything.

I love ruin plans, going against "destiny" and write my own future.

In my head there must be a way to beat the computers. Humans **have to be better**.
I believe that any form of intelligence can generate other forms of intelligence that can be anything but superior to their Creator.

**There won't be a single computational machine that's going to overtake humanity.**
_... but there may be a small slice of humanity that will use machines to overtake the bigger slice_ and that's not an event my brain would accept as it is without doing nothing.

So here's my FOMO.

I've lost about 10 years working, making bad decisions, doing _la bella vita_, partying, playing music, knowing people, learning myself.
Don't get me wrong those years were **fucking rocking** but now I need to recover and shrink:
- 10 years of **AMO** _(Actual Missing Out)_
- Into 1 year of **ETFOMOSBA** _(Escaping the Fear Of Missing Out Something Big Again)_

That's the starting point.
I hope to made some of you laugh.
I hope to made some of you hope.
That's my journey.
That could be _our_ journey.

# Day ZERO
It's important to know that _everthing_ about the course is made with AI, by now with just ChatGPT. I'm going to use other AI in future while updating this repository.
Also, I'm going through this experience while working a full-time job on shifts. Yeah. You read right. I hate myself in some ways.
Today I started doing basic things. Maybe a list should be optimal to get them down:
- [x] Set up my Notion Dashboard
  - [x] Databases
    - [x] Calendar
    - [x] Study sources
    - [x] List of exercises
  - [x] Wrote down the course program
- [x] Got GitHub ready
  - Note on this: I still need to learn how this works properly, I think it just requires time so I'm gonna go straight forward anyway
  - [x] Created the repository _(it needs a rename even if I like the actual "ImScared")_
  - [x] Created README.md file
  - [x] Set up a LICENSE
  - [x] Set up .gitignore
  - [x] Updated bio
  - [x] Wrote down this Journal first-step
The next step for this evening is to find the source of every book/paper/video/... into the "Study Sources" database, then go to sleep.
I'm excited as a kid with a new toy, if I know myself good enough I'm gonna get frustrated in very little time _and that's gonna be the hard challenge_.

I'm not gonna say I'll update this Journal everyday, especially because I don't know how much time I really have and also some days I'll just read a ton.
This Journal is gonna be half-recap and half-diary. I like that.
Cya.
